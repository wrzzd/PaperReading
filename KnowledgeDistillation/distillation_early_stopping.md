## Distillation $\approx$ Early Stopping ?
Paper Link: [Distillation â‰ˆ Early Stopping? Harvesting Dark Knowledge Utilizing Anisotropic Information Retrieval For Overparameterized Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01255)

* Dark Knowledge: the extra information provided by the soft labels generated by the pre-trained teacher network.
** the sematic similarity between different classes is part of the Dark Knowledge;
** help to refine noisy labels;
